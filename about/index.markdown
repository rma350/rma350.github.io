I am currently a software engineer at Google in Cambridge, MA.  I was previously a graduate student in the [Operations Research Center at MIT](http://www.mit.edu/~orc/), graduating in 2014.  I worked with [Itai Ashlagi](http://web.mit.edu/iashlagi/www/) and [David Gamarnik](http://www.mit.edu/~gamarnik/home.html), doing research in applied probability, stochastic processes, and integer programming. Much of my time was spent working on problems related to living donor kidney exchange.  Here are my [Google Scholar page](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8wAjOQkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en), my [Github page](https://github.com/rma350), and my [Assembla page](https://www.assembla.com/profile/rma350?public=true).

I grew up in Otego, NY. My parents still live there.  My dad built this boat:

It is for sale.  Using the boat, he caught this fish:

That could be you!  There is more information about the boat [here](http://andersonboatworks.wordpress.com/).

My dad also runs a small independent publishing company, [Otego Publishing](http://otegopublishing.wordpress.com/).
